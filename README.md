# openmct-orbital-tracker
Orbital Tracker plugin for OpenMCT

## How to use this repo
This repo is an example project for building a plugin for openMCT. The project is designed to be standalone, and makes use of the requireJS module definition pattern `define([], function...)`. You can read more on this pattern here: https://requirejs.org/docs/api.html

The included index.html is only for testing the plugin functionality, where in reality - anyone using openMCT should be able to include the plugin bundle in their project to make use of it.

## Installation and building

#### Install:
```
npm install
```

Post-install script should also install dependencies for OpenMCT.

#### Build:
```
npm run prepare
# OR...
webpack
```

The bundle gets generated by webpack. The bundle should then be included in a HTML project that implements OpenMCT.

Build configuration is defined in `webpack.config.js`

#### Installing the plugin

```
<script src="openmct-orbitaltracler.js"></script>
...
openmct.install(new OrbitalTrackerPlugin());
```

## Testing

#### Framework

Using mocha framework: https://mochajs.org/#getting-started

#### File structure

OpenMCT plugin framework hosts a script that searches for files ending in `*Spec.js`. This allows us to put all our tests in this file under a test module.

For development purposes, we also have a `test/` folder, where any tests can be added, and executed as mocha tests. An example I've added is `validate-calcs.js`, which does a simple validation test on some data.

#### Running tests

```
npm test
```
